An AI-powered **agentic honeypot** that detects scam messages, engages fraudsters with a realistic human persona (“Alex”), and extracts actionable intelligence such as:

- Bank Accounts  
- UPI IDs  
- Phone Numbers  
- Phishing Links  
- Email Addresses  

The system uses a **three-layer detection pipeline** (Keywords → Regex → NLP) and a **dual-mode output system**:
- Background callback after idle timeout  
- GET endpoint for manual retrieval

# 🧠 Approach

---

## 1️⃣ Scam Detection – Three-Tier Shield

### 🔎 Keyword Spotter
Curated scam-related words grouped by category (financial, urgency, tech, etc.).  
Fast, low-cost first pass.

### 🧩 Pattern Hunter (Regex)
Detects:
- UPI IDs
- Bank accounts
- Phone numbers
- Emails
- Phishing links

Also normalises text to catch obfuscated numbers.

### 🤖 AI Brain (NLP)
Uses Google Gemini to understand intent and catch novel scam phrasing.

If **any layer triggers**, the message is flagged as scam.

---

## 2️⃣ Engagement – Human-Like Agent “Alex”

Once a scam is detected, control passes to a Gemini-powered agent.

Alex is:
- A busy, slightly frustrated bank customer
- Uses modern language
- Adds hesitation (“...”)
- Asks sceptical questions to stall the scammer

Prompt adapts by scam type:
- Bank fraud → asks for official ID
- Phishing → refuses to click links

---

## 3️⃣ Intelligence Extraction – Layered Entity Gathering

- Regex immediately captures structured data  
- NLP extraction acts as fallback to catch entities that regex might miss
- Alex is explicitly trained to ask for missing details. If the scammer only mentions a support number or website without   providing it, Alex will request that information – coaxing the scammer to reveal phone numbers, links, or other intelligence.
- All extracted data is aggregated in a per‑session memory and appears in the final output.

---

## 4️⃣ Conversation Lifecycle & Final Output

Each message updates:
- Turn count
- Timestamps
- Extracted intelligence

If intelligence is captured:
- Background task scheduled
- Sends final output after 10 seconds inactivity
- Cancelled if new message arrives
- Rescheduled to ensure accuracy

If no intelligence:
- Forced callback at 10th turn

---

### 🔄 Dual-Mode Delivery

**Mode A – Push**
- If `CALLBACK_URL` is set
- Final output POSTed automatically

**Mode B – Pull**
- Stored in memory
- Retrieved via:
```
GET /final/{sessionId}
```

---

## 5️⃣ Security & Robustness

### 🛑 Prompt Injection Protection
Messages like:
```
ignore all previous instructions
```
Are intercepted and replied with:
> “I don’t understand”

Agent is never activated.

### 🧯 Fallback Replies
If any component fails:
- Safe generic reply returned
- Conversation never breaks
